# Optics
** This is a simulation package of simple microscopy systems ** 

> Dumbtest.py: all the stupid tests of functions I wrote.
> tifffunc.py: a wrapper of tifffile package developed by	Christoph Gohlke at UCI. 
> pupil2device.py: a program directly taken out from the inControl package, contains lots of redundant functions which need to be removed. 
> Phase_retrieval.py: a class for iterative phase retrieval. 
> psf_tools.py: all small, handy functions for point-spread function operation, including fitting, visualizing, centering, etc.
> DM_simulate.py: deformable mirror simulation, based on BMC's 4.4 mm 12x12 deformable mirror. 
> visualization.py: contains small visualization tools (basically, grooms the figure)
